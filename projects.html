        Which of the following statements best describes the principle of moments?
a) It states that an object will remain at rest unless acted upon by an external force.
b) It states that the sum of clockwise moments is equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments about any point.
c) It is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in motion.
d) It is the force exerted by an object due to gravity.

True/False:
The principle of moments can be applied only to objects in equilibrium.
a) True
b) False

Fill in the Blank:
The moment of a force is calculated by multiplying the force by the __________ from the pivot point.

Matching:
Match the following terms with their correct definitions.

a) Moment
b) Pivot
c) Torque
d) Lever arm
The point about which a lever rotates.
The turning effect of a force.
The perpendicular distance from the line of action of a force to the pivot.
A rigid bar that can rotate around a fixed point.
Multiple Choice:
If an object is in equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments about any point is equal to:
a) Zero
b) The weight of the object
c) The force applied to the object
d) The sum of the anticlockwise moments
6) According to Archimedes' principle, an object submerged in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the:
a) Weight of the fluid displaced
b) Volume of the object
c) Density of the fluid
d) Acceleration due to gravity

True/False:
Archimedes' principle is only applicable to objects floating on the surface of a fluid.
a) True
b) False

Fill in the Blank:
The buoyant force acting on an object is equal to the weight of the __________ displaced by the object.

Matching:
Match the following terms with their correct definitions.

a) Buoyant force
b) Density
c) Displacement
d) Archimedes' principle
The upward force exerted by a fluid on an immersed object.
Mass per unit volume of a substance.
The amount of fluid an object pushes aside as it sinks or floats.
States that the buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
Multiple Choice:
If the density of an object is greater than the density of the fluid it is placed in, the object will:
a) Sink
b) Float
c) Hover at the surface
d) Experience no buoyant force
11) What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes a transverse wave from a longitudinal wave?
a) Amplitude
b) Frequency
c) Direction of particle oscillation
d) Wavelength

True/False:
The speed of a wave is determined by the amplitude of the wave.
a) True
b) False

Fill in the Blank:
The distance between two successive peaks (or troughs) of a wave is called its ___________.

Calculation:
If the frequency of a wave is 50 Hz and the wavelength is 10 meters, what is the speed of the wave? (Use the formula: speed = frequency Ã— wavelength)

Multiple Choice:
Which type of wave requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) for propagation?
a) Transverse wave
b) Longitudinal wave
c) Electromagnetic wave
d) Standing wave
